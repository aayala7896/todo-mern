# Todo Mern Stack

Simple Todo App to log daily tasks.

## Project Description

This to-do app uses the Mern stack(MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). The purpose is to gain knowledge in using cloud databases and creating API routes.

- **Create Task:** Add tasks to be completed.
- **Challenges faced:** Creating routes and API endpoints were my biggest struggle.
- **Future features:** I plan on implementing delete and update functionality.
